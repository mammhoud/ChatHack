The home page features a static line chart and several bar charts that can customized as you see fit.

## How it works

> Codebase: related app, model, template,  js

**Rocket Django** seamlessly integrates charts into your Django applications, maximizing modularity and reusability. Charts are treated as a separate Django application, ensuring flexibility and ease of customization.

Key Benefits:

- Modular Design: Charts are organized into a dedicated Django application, promoting code organization and making it easy to extend and reuse chart components. The chart application can be found in the `apps/charts` folder.

- Dynamic Data Visualization: Leverage models from other applications within your project to create charts that dynamically adapt to your data.

- Customized Chart Appearance: Customize the appearance and behaviour of your charts using the readily available template located at `templates/apps/charts.html`.

- Static Chart Creation: Create charts as static assets for use in specific pages or sections of your application. The homepage charts are a prime example, residing in `static/assets/charts.js`.
